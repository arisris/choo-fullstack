## choo-fullstack
Using choo as a fullstack nodejs application with SSR support

Work in progress.

### The stack
1. Choo and tachyons as frontend
2. Express as backend
3. Fortune as database store
4. Parcel2 for build frontend code
6. And other awesome packages (package.json#dependencies)...

Keep code small is my idea

try it on your laptop

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arisris/choo-fullstack.git

cd choo-fullstack && npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Run production
npm run build && NODE_ENV=production node server

```

### Todo features

1. Implement SSR (ok)
2. Auth (wip)

Thanks.
